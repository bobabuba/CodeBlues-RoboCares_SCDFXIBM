## Short description
### Problem Statement: Emergency Medical Services
Problem to target:
1. Timely discover of incidents, especially for vulnerable populations with no one near them
2. Analysis and tracking of current situation while waiting for help to come
3. Mobilization of CFRs for effective early intervention especially to vulnerable populations

Technology
- Use of IoT to obtain readings like motion, temperature and humidity, voice to make sense of the situation
- Use of AI to develop Voice Chatbot to further analyse the situation and obtain details from victim
- Use of Data Analytics and Machine Learning to develop a model to predict whether there is an event, as well as type and severity of event, based on readings collected
- Use of IoT to notify and mobilise CFRs
- Use of Data analytics to record past incidents (accuracy of prediction of events, time taken for help to arrive etc) for future enhancements

Solution: Robocares Home Monitoring system
1. Home monitoring system to detect potential cardiac arrests, falls, unattended cooking fires, etc, and seek help from SCDF quickly
2. Live feedback of readings continues as help is being deployed to incident location
3. "Check on your neighbour" feature, perhaps with clearer instructions on incident details and possible items they need to bring along (i.e. AED, first aid kit, fire extinguisher, etc)

## Demo video
b) Pitch Video*

## The architecture
1. Home monitoring system to be installed at homes, 24hr monitoring
2. System detects potential emergency
3. System rings, then activates voice chatbot.
4. Watson Speech to Text processes audio and extracts the text
5. Watson Translation translate text to desired language
6. Watson Text to Speech for chatbot to respond to user
7. Information sent to SCDF and myResponder App, to deploy help
8. Data collection of incidents for data analysis and future enhancement
